# Changelog 📝

*The glow-up journey of your favorite AI CLI*

All the cool stuff we've added, fixed, and improved. No boring corporate speak here - just the real updates that matter to you.

## [1.0.2] - July 11, 2025 🔧

### Bug Fixes & User Experience Improvements

**Fixed the Internal Syntax Display Issue:**
- Users were seeing raw formatting syntax like `**SERON_CREATE_FILE: hi.md**` in the terminal
- Now all internal command markers are filtered out from user-visible responses
- Only clean, friendly messages are shown to users

**Smart File Handling:**
- Seron now checks if files already exist before creating them
- If a file exists, it edits the file instead of trying to create a duplicate
- No more file creation errors when files already exist

**Enhanced AI Instructions:**
- Improved system prompts to prevent internal syntax from appearing in responses
- Better guidance for AI on when to create vs edit files
- Cleaner separation between user-visible content and background operations

**What Users See Now:**
- Before: `**SERON_CREATE_FILE: filename.js**` (confusing technical syntax)
- After: "I'll create a new JavaScript file for you" + progress messages (clean and clear)

This update makes Seron much more user-friendly by hiding all the technical implementation details while still providing the same powerful automatic code execution capabilities.

## [1.0.1] - July 11, 2025 🚀

### SERON JUST GOT SUPERPOWERS

Okay so like, we literally just dropped some INSANE updates and Seron is now basically a coding wizard that does everything for you. No cap, this update is actually game-changing:

**🤖 Smart Progress Messages - You'll Know What's Happening:**
- "🤖 Seron is thinking..." - When it's processing your request
- "🤖 Seron is creating file filename.js" - Watch files get created in real-time
- "🤖 Seron is editing file package.json" - See exactly what's being modified
- "🤖 Seron is running command npm install react" - Commands execute automatically
- "🤖 Seron is installing packages..." - Package management handled for you
- "✅ Seron created file successfully" - Instant success feedback

**⚡ Automatic Code Execution - The Future is Here:**
- Just say "create a React app" and watch Seron actually build it
- No more copy-paste from terminal - Seron runs commands for you
- Automatic npm package installation when AI suggests dependencies
- File creation happens directly in your directory
- Build commands execute automatically
- Zero manual work - describe what you want, get a working project

**🎯 Enhanced Chat Experience:**
- Real-time streaming with progress feedback
- Enhanced system prompts that understand code execution
- Automatic file parsing and command extraction from AI responses
- Working directory awareness for proper file placement

**🛠️ New Technical Architecture:**
- **FileSystemService**: Handles all file operations with progress tracking
- **SeronProgress**: Smart progress message system with timing
- **Enhanced AIService**: Automatic code execution capabilities
- **Improved Chat Command**: Streaming with progress and auto-execution

**📚 Documentation Glow-Up:**
- README completely rewritten to showcase new features
- Real examples showing complete app creation
- Progress message documentation
- Enhanced CLI descriptions

**What This Actually Means:**
Before: "Hey Seron, how do I create a React app?" *gets code block* *copies to terminal*
Now: "Hey Seron, create a React app with TypeScript" *watches Seron build everything automatically*

This is literally the future of AI development tools. No more switching between chat and terminal - just describe what you want and Seron builds it for you while showing exactly what it's doing.

## [1.0.0] - July 11, 2025 🎉

### The Birth of Something Special ✨

Okay so like, we literally just dropped the first version of Seron and it's already looking pretty fire ngl. Here's everything we packed into this bad boy:

**The Squad (AI Providers We Support):**
- 🤖 **OpenAI** - The OG that started it all (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- 🧠 **Anthropic** - Claude's the thoughtful bestie we all need
- 🚀 **xAI** - Grok is literally unhinged and we're here for it
- 🤗 **HuggingFace** - Community vibes with thousands of models
- 🏠 **Ollama** - Privacy king that runs everything local

**Models That Actually Slap:**
- GPT-4 (the smart one)
- GPT-4 Turbo (the fast smart one)  
- GPT-4o (the one with eyes 👀)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (balanced king)
- Claude 3 Opus (big brain energy)
- Grok-1 & Grok-2 (chaotic energy)
- Llama 3 (open source flex)
- And like 10+ more...

**Commands That Don't Suck:**
- `seron` - Shows the fire banner (you'll see)
- `seron setup` - Gets you up and running in 2 minutes
- `seron chat` - Where the magic happens
- `seron models` - See what's available
- `seron config` - Change your vibe

**Features That Hit Different:**
- 🌊 **Real-time streaming** - No more waiting 30 seconds for responses
- 🎨 **Gradient ASCII art** - Because why be boring?
- 🔧 **Interactive setup** - Actually guides you instead of cryptic docs
- 🧙‍♂️ **Universal Code prompt** - Literally builds ANYTHING you ask for
- 🔐 **Privacy-first** - Your data stays on your machine
- 💬 **Persistent conversations** - Keep chatting until YOU decide to stop
- 🎯 **Model switching** - Change AI mid-conversation like a boss

**The Technical Flex:**
- Built with TypeScript (type safety is sexy)
- ES modules (because we're not living in 2015)
- Zero telemetry (we don't spy on you)
- Local config only (no cloud nonsense)
- Proper error handling (helpful messages, not cryptic codes)
- Streaming everywhere (when supported)

### What Makes This Different 💯

Real talk - we got tired of:
- Switching between 10 different AI websites
- Basic CLIs that break if you breathe wrong
- Tools that send your convos to random servers
- Paying for multiple subscriptions
- Waiting forever for responses

So we built Seron to fix all of that. One CLI, all the AIs, maximum privacy, minimum BS.
