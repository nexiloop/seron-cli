# Changelog 📝

*The glow-up journey of your favorite AI CLI*

All the cool stuff we've added, fixed, and improved. No boring corporate speak here - just the real updates that matter to you.

## [1.0.0] - July 11, 2025 🎉

### The Birth of Something Special ✨

Okay so like, we literally just dropped the first version of Seron and it's already looking pretty fire ngl. Here's everything we packed into this bad boy:

**The Squad (AI Providers We Support):**
- 🤖 **OpenAI** - The OG that started it all (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- 🧠 **Anthropic** - Claude's the thoughtful bestie we all need
- 🚀 **xAI** - Grok is literally unhinged and we're here for it
- 🤗 **HuggingFace** - Community vibes with thousands of models
- 🏠 **Ollama** - Privacy king that runs everything local

**Models That Actually Slap:**
- GPT-4 (the smart one)
- GPT-4 Turbo (the fast smart one)  
- GPT-4o (the one with eyes 👀)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (balanced king)
- Claude 3 Opus (big brain energy)
- Grok-1 & Grok-2 (chaotic energy)
- Llama 3 (open source flex)
- And like 10+ more...

**Commands That Don't Suck:**
- `seron` - Shows the fire banner (you'll see)
- `seron setup` - Gets you up and running in 2 minutes
- `seron chat` - Where the magic happens
- `seron models` - See what's available
- `seron config` - Change your vibe

**Features That Hit Different:**
- 🌊 **Real-time streaming** - No more waiting 30 seconds for responses
- 🎨 **Gradient ASCII art** - Because why be boring?
- 🔧 **Interactive setup** - Actually guides you instead of cryptic docs
- 🧙‍♂️ **Universal Code prompt** - Literally builds ANYTHING you ask for
- 🔐 **Privacy-first** - Your data stays on your machine
- 💬 **Persistent conversations** - Keep chatting until YOU decide to stop
- 🎯 **Model switching** - Change AI mid-conversation like a boss

**The Technical Flex:**
- Built with TypeScript (type safety is sexy)
- ES modules (because we're not living in 2015)
- Zero telemetry (we don't spy on you)
- Local config only (no cloud nonsense)
- Proper error handling (helpful messages, not cryptic codes)
- Streaming everywhere (when supported)

### What Makes This Different 💯

Real talk - we got tired of:
- Switching between 10 different AI websites
- Basic CLIs that break if you breathe wrong
- Tools that send your convos to random servers
- Paying for multiple subscriptions
- Waiting forever for responses

So we built Seron to fix all of that. One CLI, all the AIs, maximum privacy, minimum BS.
